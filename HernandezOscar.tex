Far away
The ship is taking me far away
Far away from the memories
Of the people who care if I live or die

Starlight
I will be chasing the starlight
Until the end of my life
I don´t know if it´s worth it anymore

Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold
You in my arms

My life
You electrify my life
Let´s conspire to ignite
All the souls that would die just to feel alive

But I´ll never let you go
If you promised not to fade away
Never fade away

Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
